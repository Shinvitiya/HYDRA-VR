<img src="./public/preview.png">

---
Based on the design by [Zine E. Falouti](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1196146735025729739) , HYDRA VR is a sleek, modern and responsive website built using the latest frontend technologies. This was built with reusablity in mind. The content can the edited to whatever you need and the job is made fairly simple, even for someone with little-to-no tech background.

## Built with üîß

Listed below  are the technologies utilized in building HYDRA-VR.

* React 
* Material Tailwind
* Vite
## Getting started  üñ•Ô∏è

To get started, you need `NodeJS`  and `git` to be installed locally in your computer. 

To check if node and git are installed on your computer, run the following commands on your terminal.

```
$ node --version
```
```
$ git --version
```
This should return a version  number if they are installed. If not you can download them here.

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/en)


Once downloaded, clone or download the project and open it in your code editor and run the following commands.

```
$ npm install
```
```
$ npm run dev
```

This should download all the dependencies and run the app in development mode.

You can view it on your browser through [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## How to make changes üñäÔ∏è

The vast majority of the text displayed can be edited through `constants.js` which can the accessed through `src/constants/constants.js`

All you have to do is edit the code here.


Below is a preview of `constants.js` file.
``` js
 export const cards =[{
    id: "simulation",
    heading: "SIMULATION",
    description: "Vitae sapien pellentesque habitant morbi nunc. Viverra aliquet porttitor rhoncus libero justo laoreet sit amet vitae.",
    button: "TRY IT NOW",
    image: uses01
  },
  {
    id: "education",
    heading: "EDUCATION",
    description: "Vitae sapien pellentesque habitant morbi nunc. Viverra aliquet porttitor rhoncus libero justo laoreet sit amet vitae.",
    button: "TRY IT NOW",
    url: "https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    image: uses03
  },
  {
    id: "self-care",
    heading: "SELF-CARE",
    description: "Vitae sapien pellentesque habitant morbi nunc. Viverra aliquet porttitor rhoncus libero justo laoreet sit amet vitae.",
    button: "TRY IT NOW",
    url: "https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    image: uses04
  },
  {
    id: "outdoor",
    heading: "OUTDOOR",
    description: "Vitae sapien pellentesque habitant morbi nunc. Viverra aliquet porttitor rhoncus libero justo laoreet sit amet vitae.",
    url: "https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    button: "TRY IT NOW",
    image: uses02
  }
]
```
To change images navigate to `src/assets`

If you don't want to hassle yourself with going thorugh the code to edit the images, replace them with   new images renamed with that of the previous.

Ofcourse, if you know how to navigate your way around code, the changes you could make are endless. Have fun XD
